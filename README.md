# ⚡ Thunder F722 Drone Flight Controller ⚡
A simple, one-sided, cheap flight controller for the practical FPV Pilot.

## Quick Notice :dollar:
This project was initially close-source. We opened to be part of a greater achievement for the FPV community, as well as to expand reach and dissipate knowledge. By doing so, we lost a great share of revenue. To support its constant evolution, [consider a donation][1].

## Short Read :envelope:
This FC (Flight Controller) was developed to be an open-source playground for FPV pilots. Although that's the main objective for now, please be aware that untested modifications can make your drone go crazy. So if you don't exactly know what you are doing, please take it with a grain of salt.
Also, make sure you are using it with a Skystars ESC since the pinout is configured to that.

## Long Read :book:

### Objectives :dart:
Developed to be an alternative to commercials freestyle FCs, with a one-side-only configuration to smash the builds and to pay less in assembly, the Thunder F722 FC is a must in any pilot's drone. It's configured in a simple layout, doesn't have an OSD (because I truly believe it's not needed for freestyle), and regulates to 5V and 9V. It uses a 6-layer stack-up and is compliant with most manufacturing capabilities, to be easily assembled.

### Editing and Modifying the Files :rocket:
You can modify and fork this repo and change the files. The PCB and Assembly were both made in EasyEDA for fast time-to-market using JLCPCB. Upload the schematic and PCB layout there to edit the files. Please pay attention to the license requirements below.
