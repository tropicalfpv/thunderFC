##Warnings For Low-Cost Build

This low-cost design is the same files as the full but does not include some connectors, the boot button, and both the inductors of the power supply. This is something I did to help make it cheaper for my testing and is advised to not use this in a normal build. Please check the missing components, the gerber, and the assembly files before proceeding.
